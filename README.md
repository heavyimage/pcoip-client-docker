## pcoip-client-docker
This is a fork of PaulGallon's pcoip-client-docker that brings it a bit more up to date.

This lets you run Teradici's PCoIP Client for Linux in a Docker container; this repo works on my Debian bullseye/sid i3 Intel NUC running dwm.

YMMV.

### Setup
* Don't forget to update the Dockerfile with your own uid/gid (so bad).

### Thanks
* @jlucas for the logo
